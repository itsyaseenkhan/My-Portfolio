# Cloudinary Image Management System

This portfolio project now includes a comprehensive Cloudinary-based image management system for handling all image uploads, storage, and optimization.

## 🚀 Features

- **Cloud Storage**: All images are stored on Cloudinary instead of local filesystem
- **Automatic Optimization**: Images are automatically optimized for web delivery
- **Responsive Images**: Multiple sizes generated for different devices
- **Image Transformations**: Automatic resizing, format conversion, and quality optimization
- **Secure Uploads**: File type validation and size limits
- **Easy Management**: Upload, update, and delete images with automatic cleanup

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Cloudinary Credentials

1. Create a free account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
2. Go to your Dashboard
3. Copy your credentials:
   - Cloud Name
   - API Key
   - API Secret

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `Backends` directory with the following variables:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

# Other required variables
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

The required packages are already in package.json:
- `cloudinary`: Official Cloudinary SDK
- `multer`: File upload handling
- `multer-storage-cloudinary`: Cloudinary storage for Multer

```bash
cd Backends
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
# or
node Server.js
```

## 📋 API Endpoints

## 🎨 Image Transformations

The system includes predefined transformations for different use cases:

### Profile Images
- Size: 400x400px
- Crop: Fill with face detection
- Quality: Auto good

### Project Images
- Size: Limited to 1200x800px
- Crop: Limit (maintains aspect ratio)
- Quality: Auto good

### Thumbnails
- Size: 300x200px
- Crop: Fill
- Quality: Auto eco

### Gallery Images
- Size: Limited to 800x600px
- Crop: Limit
- Quality: Auto good

## 🔧 Using the Image Service

```javascript
const ImageService = require('./services/imageService');

// Upload single image
const result = await ImageService.uploadSingle(fileBuffer, {
  folder: 'projects',
  transformation: ImageService.getTransformationsFor('project')
});

// Upload multiple images
const results = await ImageService.uploadMultiple(files, 'gallery');

// Delete image
await ImageService.delete(publicId);

// Replace image (upload new, delete old)
const newImage = await ImageService.replace(fileBuffer, oldPublicId, options);

// Generate responsive URLs
const responsiveUrls = ImageService.generateResponsiveUrls(publicId);
```

## 🎯 Frontend Integration

Use the provided `ImageUpload.jsx` component for testing or as a reference:

```jsx
import ImageUpload from './components/ImageUpload';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ImageUpload />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🔒 Security Features

- **File Type Validation**: Only image files allowed
- **Size Limits**: Maximum 5MB per file
- **Secure URLs**: All images served over HTTPS
- **Access Control**: Cloudinary handles secure delivery

## 📱 Responsive Images

The system automatically generates multiple sizes for responsive design:

- Mobile: 480px width
- Tablet: 768px width
- Desktop: 1200px width
- Large: 1920px width

## 🚨 Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- Upload failures
- Invalid file types
- Size limit exceeded
- Network errors
- Cloudinary API errors

## 🔄 Migration from Local Storage

If you have existing local images, you'll need to:

1. Upload them to Cloudinary manually or via script
2. Update your database records with new Cloudinary URLs and metadata
3. Remove old local image files

## 📊 Monitoring and Analytics

Cloudinary provides built-in analytics for:
- Image views and downloads
- Bandwidth usage
- Storage usage
- Transformation usage

Access these in your Cloudinary dashboard.

## 🎨 Advanced Features

### Custom Transformations
```javascript
const customOptions = {
  transformation: [
    { width: 500, height: 500, crop: 'fill' },
    { effect: 'blur:300' },
    { quality: 'auto:best' }
  ]
};
```

### Conditional Transformations
```javascript
const conditionalTransform = {
  transformation: [
    { if: 'w_gt_1000', width: 1000, crop: 'scale' },
    { if: 'else', width: 500, crop: 'scale' }
  ]
};
```
